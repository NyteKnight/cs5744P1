        The year 2020 has seen restaurants, gathering spaces, sporting events, and more close down indefinitely due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This has caused people to flock to grocery stores in efforts to secure ingredients to keep their families fed. Many people would like to cook, but don’t know how. Some have ingredients, but have no idea how to make them into a satisfying meal. Still others may be uncomfortable going out to get groceries amidst the pandemic and more comfortable ordering their meals over the internet. Our product “Chef It!” seeks to resolve these problems and more by providing a platform for experts and newbies alike to share recipes complete with ingredient lists, helpful instructions, ratings, and reviews. Chef It! also allows users to stream video tutorials to assist beginner cooks.

      <p>
        For this product, the customer will be our users. Our platform will not target any one group of people, but instead appeal to all ages, cultural backgrounds, and geographies. The benefit we see to choosing this method is that we will invite the widest array of cuisine if we can attract the most diverse user-base. The key to making this diversity target feasible is to make the application simple to navigate and provide a user experience that maintains a high customer retention rate.
